# Matching-flavour
Building AI course project

## Summary
My idea would be an AI able to suggest matching flavors when users are looking for recipes.
When the user find a recipe on the internet, the AI can automatically suggest many different alternative for each ingredient. This can help to make it easier to get everything necessary.

## Background
It may happen that I can find the perfect recipe on the internet but one or more ingredients are difficult to find in the supermarket or the user do not want to use them for any reason:
* Being vegan
* Having intolerances
* Religious purpose
* Preference for ingredients with a lower environmental impact

## How is it used?
This solution may help in so many different ways. A user can save money by using less expensive ingredients and by spending less time to retrive them. Moreover it may help to be more conscious about the environmental impact of our choices.

## Data sources and AI methods
It is necessary to start by creating a library of matching flavors. This could be done by scanning the already existing libraries of recipes from different cooking sites.
In this way would be possible to find the most used flavor matches.
As a second step it is necessary to find an environmental index impact for each ingredients to allow the user to prefer more environmental friendly ingredients.

## Challenges
The most challenging obstacle will be the environmental score for each ingredients since it is hard to get the index for water usage, energy consumption etc. necessary to grew/breed the food, but I think that can be achieved by involving more entities to the project.

## What next?
It is necessary share this idea with some eco-friendly start-up and maybe involve also some food influencer to make this idea more popular.
